### **How It Works**
1. **Local Changes**: Any changes you make locally (e.g., edits to `script.js`, `grant_calls.json`, or `index.html`) will not automatically appear on GitHub Pages.
2. **Pushing to GitHub**: You need to use Git commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to send the changes to GitHub.
3. **Live Update**: Once the changes are pushed, GitHub Pages updates your site automatically.

### **Strategies for Pushing Changes**

#### **1. Push After Every Change**
- **Pros**:
  - Keeps your GitHub repository up-to-date.
  - Lets you quickly see the impact of every small change on GitHub Pages.
- **Cons**:
  - Can clutter your commit history with minor changes.

#### **2. Push After Testing Locally**
- Make multiple changes and test them locally.
- Once you’re satisfied, stage and commit all changes together, then push.
- **Pros**:
  - Cleaner commit history.
  - Minimizes unnecessary pushes.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires disciplined local testing.

### **Efficient Workflow**
1. **Make Changes Locally**:
   - Edit files as needed.
   - Test your updates using a local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
2. **Stage Changes**:
   - Add all the files you’ve modified:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
3. **Commit Changes**:
   - Use a descriptive commit message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Updated search functionality and UI"
     ```
4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push the changes:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```
5. **Verify on GitHub Pages**:
   - Visit your live site to confirm the changes.

### **Pro Tip: Use Git Branches**
For more complex updates or experiments:
1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. Make and test changes locally.
3. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
4. Merge the branch into `main` once everything works:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   git push origin main
   ```
